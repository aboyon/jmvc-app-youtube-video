## jmvc-youtube-video-app

This is just an example application written in [JavascriptMVC](javascriptmvc.com) that aims to show you how to make an application with a popular API service.

In this case we'll use the API provided by youtube to retrieve information based on a given link.

### How it works

This is a very simple example about how to persist the user data using localStorage thru JavascriptMVC models layer. You can replace localStorage for the one you choose (e.g. if you want to persist the information into a cookie, or even better, make a request using AJAX to a server-side script using Ruby/PHP/whatever)
